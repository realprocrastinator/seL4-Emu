	<div align='center'><h3>Client Side Emulation Library Summary</h3></div>
	<p>At this stage, we have solved most of the problems regarding the client side emulation library.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li> emulation runtime library sets up the TLS, IPC Buffer.
	<li> seL4 IPC emulation implementation using UNIX Domain Sockets to pass the message registers as well as the emulated register set.
	<li> the IPC emulation library distinguishes the seL4 IPCs and the emulation internal IPCs using two different protocols.
	<li> memory mapping emulation implementation uses signal handlers to capture the VM fault and might do lazy mapping on-demand or halt the execution.
	<li> one seL4 thread is mapped to one Linux process.
	</ul>	
	
	<p>However, we haven't discussed the rest of the problems in detail.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li> How does the kernel emulator run?
	<li> How does the kernel emulator start the roottask?
	<li> How do we emulate physical memory?
	<li> How does the kernel emulator start the roottask?
	<li> How can kernel distinguish different seL4 applications?
	<li> How to emulate the scheduling?
	</ul>
	<p>
	The following slides will focus on discussing those questions.
