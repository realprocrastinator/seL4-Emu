	<center><h3>Physical Memory Emulation Implementation
	</h3></center>
	
	<p>To implement this we are going to use the <code>shm_open</code> to create a shared memory and use this as our <b>emulated physical memory</b> as well as the <b>1:1 physical mapping area in the kernel window</b></p>

	<p>Therefore, we also solved the challenge of passing bootinfo to the roottask as well as accessing IPC buffer.</p>

	<ul>
	<li> to pass the bootinfo, we first locate the bootinfo frame by calculating the offset.  
	<li> pass the offset using emulation internal IPC to the seL4 application.
	<li> seL4 application maps a page for the part of the file based on the offset.
	<li> the same method makes mapping IPC buffer work as well.
