	<p>The current implementation solved most of the fundamental problems. And can emulate simple roottask and most of the kernel functionalities. <small>(cnodes, vspace, tcb, etc.)</small></p>

	However, due to the time limits <small>(I've been blocked on some problems and bugs for quite a long time)</small> and my knowledge. There are still lots of work that haven't been done yet.

	<h4>Still working on it, might be finished soon</h4>

	<ul>

	<li> About emulating scheduling, I've just come up with the idea recently, still implementing it.
		<ul>
			<li> To emulate thread suspension, we can use blocking sockets, so each time kernel uses the scheduling algorithm to determine the next running seL4 thread and only replies to it. Hence all other seL4 threads will block on the socket except one that has been chosen. 
			<li> To emulate the preemption, we can set a timer in the kernel emulator, and signal our seL4 application, then the signal handler routine is invoked and block on the socket until the next IPC message is passed from the kernel emulator telling it to resume.
	</ul>
	
	<li> User-configurable kernel booting emulation. <small>(rootask image, physical memory size, platform information, etc.)</small>

	<li> Running multiple seL4 threads. <small>(Partially done)</small>
	
	<li> Once the previous step is done, we should be able to run CAmkES on the emulation framework.
